Hive
----

Invented by Facebook.
Hive is a Query Engine. Not a database.
Uses SQL to communicate with Map Reduce instead of Java code.
Abstraction of Map Reduce.

Install hive.
CLI and Hive server.

Hive server stores metadata of table - columns, indexes etc.
Hive metadata is stored in RDBMS. RDBMS is required for Hive.
This is also known as remote meta store.
Hive does not store the information itself. Data is stored in HDFS itself.
Insert/load data is stored in HDFS.
Read queries on table will look up metadata information and then retrieve data from HDFS and output result in table form.

If RDBMS is not installed for Hive, Hive will store metadata in Embedded RDBMS called Derby.

Why not Embedded meta store?
Embedded data store is local to hive server. In a cluster of hive nodes, the meta data will not be shared.
For example create table request will execute on one node and read request will execute on another node which will not have the table itself.
