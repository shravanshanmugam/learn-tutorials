Hadoop
------

2002 - GFS - Distributed Google File System -> Storing
2004 - GMR - Map Reduce -> Processing

2005-2006 - Hadoop -> HDFS, Map Reduce

Distributed data - For parallel processing

Hadoop Ecosystem
----------------
1. HDFS
2. Map Reduce
Components of Map Reduce Framework.
3. Hive -> interact with Map Reduce via SQL. Created by Facebook
4. Pig -> scripting language of Pig Latin. run Map Reduce using Pig Latin. Created by Yahoo
5. Sqoop -> configurations and commands to move data from RDBMS <-> Hadoop i.e. import and export [Data pipeline]
6. Uzi -> scheduler to run Hadoop jobs. Created by Yahoo
Above components are abstracts of Map Reduce
7. HBase -> hbase shell commands. NoSQL data on Hadoop. Created by Facebook
8. Mahout -> Data science component on Hadoop
9. Flume -> Real time data processing. Messaging Queue component. DB -> Hadoop [Data pipeline]

Features
--------
Loosely coupled framework - removing one component will not break the system
Integration - Hadoop with any other Big Data framework or non Big Data framework

Storing -> HDFS, HBase
Processing -> Map Reduce, Hive, Pig
Data pipeline -> Sqoop, Flume
Uzi -> Scheduler
Mahout -> Data science
