Map Reduce
----------

Processing framework (batch/massive/parallel/distributed)

Advantages
----------

Cluster monitoring
Resource allocation
Cluster management
Scheduling
Execution
Speculative execution

Aim - achieve data locality
Identify location where block of data is stored and execute task on that location

Abstraction of Map Reduce
-------------------------

Hive, Pig, Sqoop, Oozie

Alternate of Map Reduce
-----------------------

Spark

Daemons in Map Reduce
---------------------

Job tracker and Task tracker - H1
Resource manager and Node manager - H2

Map transformation - parallelize
Reduce transformation - aggregate

Mapper
------

Input - Blocks, HDFS, File system, RDBMS, NoSQL etc.

Number of Mappers = Number of blocks = Size of data/Size of 1 block

Reducer
-------

Input - output of Mapper
Output - HDFS, File system, RDBMS, NoSQL etc.

Number of reducers >= 1
