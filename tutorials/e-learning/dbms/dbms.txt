Database Normalization:

Idea is to Minimize data redundancy

I. First Normal Form
--------------------

1. No two columns should have same name E.g. |id|name|subject|
2. Each column should have value of the same type
3. Order of insertion should not matter
4. Multiple values should not be stored in a single column E.g. |1|Shravan|Java,C++| is not right form

II. Second Normal Form
----------------------
1. First Normal Form
2. No Partial Dependency

E.g.
id | studentId | subjectId | marks | teacher
1  | 1		   | 1		   | 100   | K
2  | 1		   | 2		   | 90    | L
3  | 2		   | 1		   | 80    | K
4  | 3		   | 1		   | 70    | K
5  | 3		   | 2		   | 60    | L

id - Uniquely identifies a row => Primary key
studentId + subjectId - Uniquely identifies a row e.g. marks of studentId and subjectId => Primary key
Functional dependency : a non-prime attribute which depends on the primary attribute

But teacher column is dependent only on subjectId
Partial dependency : a non-prime attribute which depends only on part of the primary attribute

Solution: Keep separate table for teacher like |subjectId|subject|teacher| 
or like |teacherId|teacher| 

III. Third Normal Form
----------------------
1. Second Normal Form
2. No Transitive dependency

E.g.
id|studentId|subjectId|marks|examName|totalMarks

examName depend on both studentId and subjectId
But totalMarks depend on examName
But examName is not a part of primary key
Transitive dependency : a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute which is not part of the primary attribute 

Solution: Two tables like
id|studentId|subjectId|marks|examName
examName|totalMarks

IV. Boyce-Codd Normal Form
--------------------------
1. Third Normal Form
2. For B depends on A, A should be super key meaning A cannot be non-prime attribute if B is prime attribute or in other words A has to be prime attribute

E.g.
studentId|subject|professor
1		 | Java  |Prof. 1 of Java
2 		 | C++	 |Prof. 1 of C++
3  		 | Java  |Prof. 2 of Java

studentId + subject is primary key
professor can uniquely identify subject but professor is not primary key
subject is dependent on professor

Solution: Break the table
studentId|professorId
professorId|professor|subject

V. Fourth Normal Form
---------------------
1. Boyce-Codd Normal Form
2. No Multi-Valued dependency

Multi-Valued dependency : 
1. B depends on A, for single value of A more than one value of B exists
2. Also it should have atleast 3 columns for Multi-Valued dependency
3. For table with columns A,B and C, B and C should be independent

Solution: Break the tables by columns which are independent
