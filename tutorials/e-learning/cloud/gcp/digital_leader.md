# Cloud computing
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,
manage and process data, rather than a local server or personal computer

# Cloud Hosting

## Dedicated Server
- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- Runs a website or app
- Very expensive, High maintenance
- High security
## Virtual Private Server
-  One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines
- Runs multiple websites or apps
## Shared Hosting
- One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses
- Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources
- Very cheap, Very limited
## Cloud Hosting
- Multiple physical machines that act as one system
- The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services
- Flexible, Scalable
- Secure, Cost-effective
- High configurability

# Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
A company which provides multiple Cloud Services and those cloud services can be chained
together to create cloud architectures

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Google calls their cloud provider service offering Google Cloud Platform

# Google Workspace (G-Suite)
A bundled offering of SaaS products for team communication, collaboration for an
organisation

  cost of the resources
- Global
  - Launch workloads anywhere in the world
  - Just choose a region
- Secure
  - Cloud provider takes care of physical security
  - Cloud services can be secure by default
  - You have the ability to configure access down to a granular level
- Reliable
  - Data backup
  - Disaster recovery
  - Data replication
  - Fault tolerance
- Scalable
  - Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
- Elastic
  - Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand
- Current
  - The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced
  by the cloud provide without interruption to you

# Common Cloud Services
A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types
of services. The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a 
Service (IaaS) would be
- Compute - virtual computer to run applications, programs, code
- Storage - virtual hardware to store files
- Networking - virtual network being able to define internet connections or network isolations
- Databases - virtual database to for storing reporting data or a database for general

# Types of cloud computing

## Software as a Service (SaaS) - For Customers
A product that is run and managed by the service provider.
Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remains available.
Example: Salesforce, Gmail, Office 365

## Platform as a Service (PaaS) - For Developers
Focus on the deployment and management of your apps.
Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS.
Example: AWS ElasticBeanStalk, Heroku, Google App Engine

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - For Admins
The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers
and data storage space.
Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware
Example: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud
