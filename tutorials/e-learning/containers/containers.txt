Containers

1. Kubernetes
	- Greek for 'Helmsman'
	- also the root for the word 'Governor'
	- Container orchestrator
	- runs containers
	- supports multiple cloud and bare-metal environments
	- open source, written in Go
	- spotify has a docker maven plugin that builds docker image when building Java application
2. Kubernetes features
	- labels to identify running containers
	- pod - atomic unit managed by kubernets
	- pod can have single container or multiple containers
	- all containers in pod have same IP
	- all containers in pod live/die together
	- guaranteed to be scheduled on to the same physical machine
	- e.g. frontend & backend in separate pods as you cannot scale independently if they are in same pod
	- e.g. auxillary services/application can be kept in same pod
	- service - like a load balancer that gives a stable IP address that will be able to load balance requests
	- routing happens with help of labels
	- service discovery/registry
	- volume mount registry and persistence volume claim 
3. NFS - Network File System
	- shared hard drive used by server over network with clients
	- commonly used data can be stored on a single machine and remains accessible to others over network
	- home directories can also be setup on NFS instead of every network machine
4. Kubernetes vs Docker - https://thehftguy.com/2016/11/01/docker-in-production-an-history-of-failure/
One of the [future] major breakthrough is the ability to manage fleets of containers abstracted away from the machines they end up running on, with automatic start/stop/rolling-update and capacity adjustment,
The issue with Docker is that it doesn’t do any of that. It’s just a dumb container system. It has the drawbacks of containers without the benefits.

6. Kubernetes Helm chart - manage container manifests
7. Heptio ark - Disaster Recovery
8. Istio - Service mesh
9. Jenkins X - CI/CD for Kubernetes applications
10. Skaffold - facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications
