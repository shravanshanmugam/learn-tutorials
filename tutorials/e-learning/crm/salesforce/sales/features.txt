Building blocks of Salesforce Apps
----------------------------------
1. Tabs - access objects (tables) in Salesforce App. Display list of records stored in an object
2. Profiles - collection of settings and permissions which controls what a user can view, access and modify in Salesforce
(Based on roles or groups)
3. Objects - database tables where data is present
4. Fields - Individual data points of an object
5. Records - collection of fields with values for fields and represent an instance of an object

Features
--------

1. Customize fields to view in object
Available Fields - all fields on left pane
(add/remove button between left and right pane)
Selected Fields - required fields on right pane
(up/down button to choose order)

2. Custom App
Select tabs from pre-defined list
Available objects/Selected objects/Default landing object

3. Create object
name, label
field name, label, data type
optional features - allow reports, allow activities, track field history, allow in chat groups
object classification - allow sharing, allow bulk api access, allow streaming api access

5. Custom fields and relationships
Data type

Visibility - only me, all users or users in group

6. Field dependencies - controlling field and dependent field
Include and exclude values for each controlling field from overall list of dependent fields
i. Master-Details relationship - parent & child relationship - child looks up parent object
child requires parent object
child inherits parent properties/settings
if parent is deleted, child is also deleted (cascade delete)
ii. Lookup relationship - parent & child relationship (one to many)
child does not require parent object
child does not inherit parent settings
if parent is deleted, child is not deleted (no cascade delete)

7. Page layout (for objects)
create sections (one/two column section for left & right)
customize section name
tab-key order

8. Validation rules
i. Rule name, active, error condition formula (fields, operators & functions) error message
functions - isBlank, isNull, length, includes, or, and, logical etc.
ii. formula fields - calculates 3rd field based on formula on 2 fields

Users, Profiles, Permission sets and Roles
------------------------------------------
users have profiles
profiles are like teams or groups
profiles have defined permissions sets
profiles have access to only certain objects, fields etc.
access can be read, create, edit, delete for basic or view all, modify all for data administration access
permission sets extends functionality of profiles (to give few more permissions)
permissions sets are user level access to objects, fields etc.
roles (view/edit data within or outside profile)

hierarchy - P parent of A and B, then P can access A and B's data
A cannot access P & B's data
B cannot access P & A's data
M parent of P can access P, A and B's data
