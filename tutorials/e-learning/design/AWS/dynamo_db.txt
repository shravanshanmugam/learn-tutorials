Dynamo DB - https://medium.com/@lewisdgavin/aws-dynamodb-overview-184e53aedcd6

- NoSQL database - low latency and large scales
- document and key-value storage
- stored in SSD storage 
- distributed across 3 geographically distinct data centers for redundancy
- support for eventual (default) and strongly consistent reads

How it works?
- Tables (like collection)
- Items (row in table)
- Attributes (column or field in table)

- must have primary key
	- partition key - single attribute - field that uniquely identifies the row (like auto-generated, unique product id)
	- partition key & sort key - composite key - combo of two fields that uniquely identifies row and how data should be naturally sorted
	(like unique product id and purchase date timestamp)
- partition key must be unique and sparse
