/**
 * The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items.
 * In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1.
 * An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
 * T(n) = O(n log n log n), Best case T(n) = O(n log n) when elements are already in sorted order, Worst case = O(n^2)
 * S(n) = O(1)
